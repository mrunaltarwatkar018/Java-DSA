# Understanding Flowcharts, Algorithms, and Pseudocode

---

## What is a Flowchart?

A **flowchart** is a visual diagram that represents a process or workflow. It uses symbols and arrows to show the sequence of steps involved in solving a problem. Essentially, it is a **graphical representation of an algorithm** or a step-by-step solution to a task.

## Components of a Flowchart

A flowchart is made up of **symbols (boxes)** and **connectors (arrows)** to represent and link different stages of a process.

### Common Symbols Used in a Flowchart:

1. **Oval** – Denotes the **Start or End** of the flowchart.
2. **Arrow** – Indicates the **direction or flow** of control between steps.
3. **Parallelogram** – Represents **input or output** operations (e.g., reading a value or displaying a result).
4. **Rectangle** – Used to show a **process or instruction** to be carried out.
5. **Diamond** – Represents a **decision point** (e.g., yes/no or true/false branching).

## What is a Process?

In computing, a **process** is an **instance of a program that is currently being executed**. It includes the program code and its activity.

---

## What is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a **step-by-step set of instructions** designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.

- It is usually written in **plain, simple language**.
- Unlike flowcharts or code, an algorithm does **not follow strict syntax rules**.

---

## What is Pseudocode?

**Pseudocode** is a **simplified, code-like version of an algorithm**.

- It is not actual code, but it closely **resembles programming logic**.
- Pseudocode helps in planning and understanding the structure of the program before actual coding.
