# üß† What is a Programming Language?

Just like humans use languages to communicate with each other, programmers use **programming languages** to communicate with computers.  
A **programming language** is a formal set of instructions that can be used to perform specific tasks or solve problems with a computer.

# üßæ Categories of Programming Languages

## üîπ 1. Machine Language
- A **low-level language** consisting purely of binary digits (0s and 1s).
- Directly understood by the computer‚Äôs hardware.
- **No translator** is needed; it runs directly on the machine.

## üîπ 2. Assembly Language
- Another low-level language, more readable than machine language.
- Uses **mnemonics** (symbolic codes) for operations.
- Requires an **assembler** to convert it to machine language.

## üîπ 3. High-Level Language
- Designed to be **human-readable** and easy to write.
- Needs a **compiler or interpreter** to translate the code into machine-understandable form.
- Examples include **C, Java, Python, etc.**

# üîç Types of High-Level Programming Paradigms

## ‚úÖ A. Procedural Programming Language
- Follows a **step-by-step approach** to execute instructions.
- Breaks programs into **functions or procedures**.
- Also known as **structured programming**.
- **Examples:** C, FORTRAN.

## ‚úÖ B. Functional Programming Language
- Treats computation as the **evaluation of mathematical functions**.
- Avoids changing-state and mutable data.
- Functions take inputs and return outputs without side effects.
- **Examples:** Haskell, Python.

## ‚úÖ C. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Language
- Based on the concept of **objects** (data + behavior).
- Promotes **reusability** and **modular code**.
- Helps in organizing complex programs by bundling data and functions.
- **Example:** Java, C++, Python.

## ‚úÖ D. Scripting Language
- Interpreted at **runtime**, executing code **line-by-line**.
- Easier and faster to write compared to compiled languages.
- Often used for automation, web scripting, and quick prototyping.
- **Examples:** JavaScript, Python, Bash.

## ‚úÖ E. Statically Typed Language
- **Data types are declared explicitly**.
- Type checking is done at **compile time**.
- Helps catch errors early.
- **Examples:** C, Java, C++.

## ‚úÖ F. Dynamically Typed Language
- **No need to declare data types** explicitly.
- Type checking occurs during **runtime**.
- Offers more flexibility, especially for scripting.
- **Examples:** Python, JavaScript, Ruby.

# üíæ Memory Management in Java

Java handles memory **automatically** using a mechanism called **Garbage Collection**, which frees memory by removing objects that are no longer used.

## üî∏ Stack Memory vs Heap Memory

| Feature         | Stack Memory                          | Heap Memory                          |
|---------------- |---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Usage           | Stores **method-level variables**     | Stores **objects and instance data** |
| Allocation      | Managed **last-in-first-out (LIFO)**  | Managed **dynamically**              |
| Speed           | Faster                                | Slower                               |
| Size            | Limited                               | Larger                               |
