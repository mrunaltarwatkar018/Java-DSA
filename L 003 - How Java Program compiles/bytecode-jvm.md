# üåü Introduction to Java

**Java** is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, security, and robustness.  
It is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, Android apps, and backend systems.

### Key Highlights:
- Owned by **Oracle Corporation**
- **Free and open-source**
- Based on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, making code modular, maintainable, and reusable

# üìú History of Java

- Java was created by **James Gosling** and his team at **Sun Microsystems** (later acquired by Oracle) in **1995**.
- Initially, the language was called **"Greentalk"**, developed for interactive television systems.
- Later renamed to **"Oak"**, inspired by an oak tree outside Gosling‚Äôs office.
- Finally, it was named **"Java"** ‚Äî inspired by Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.  
  Gosling coined the name while drinking coffee near his office.

> Java's coffee cup logo pays tribute to the caffeine-fueled efforts of the engineers behind it.

# ‚òï Why the Coffee Cup Logo?

- The **Java logo** is a **blue coffee cup with red steam**.
- It symbolizes the **Java coffee beans** consumed by the developers during its creation.
- The logo represents energy, creativity, and innovation ‚Äî just like a strong cup of coffee!

# üß∞ What is JDK?

**JDK (Java Development Kit)** is a software package that provides the tools necessary to develop and run Java programs.

### It includes:
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: For running Java applications.
- **JDT (Java Development Tools)**: Includes the compiler, debugger, and other tools.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Executes Java bytecode specific to the host operating system.

> JVM acts as an interpreter and varies by operating system, but Java code remains the same.

# üåê Why is Java Platform-Independent?

- Java programs are compiled into **bytecode**, which is **OS-independent**.
- The **JVM** interprets or compiles this bytecode into machine-specific instructions.
- This "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle makes Java platform-independent at the **code level**, although the JVM itself is platform-dependent.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Java Compilation Process

Java follows a **two-step compilation model**:

1. **Compilation**:
   - Source files (`.java`) are compiled by the **Java compiler (javac)**.
   - The result is a `.class` file containing **bytecode**.

2. **Execution**:
   - Bytecode is executed by the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, which interprets or compiles it into machine code.

---

# üß™ JVM Execution Stages

When a Java program runs, it goes through the following stages:

### 1. ClassLoader
- Loads the `.class` files into memory.
- Dynamically loads other referenced classes as needed.
- Maintains a namespace of class names and their corresponding definitions.

### 2. Bytecode Verifier
- Ensures the bytecode is safe to execute.
- Performs checks such as:
  - All variables are initialized before use.
  - Stack memory is accessed correctly.
  - No illegal type casts or code manipulations.

### 3. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler
- Converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime.
- Optimizes performance by compiling code segments that are frequently executed.
